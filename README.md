# Malloc
A dynamically allocated memory management library. I rewrote the following libc functions: malloc(3), free(3), realloc(3)

# Build
You should have `make` and `gcc` install in your system.
- sudo apt install gcc
- sudo apt install make

If you have everything, you can build the project with `make`.
